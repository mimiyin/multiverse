I have to have 2
with nothing
except for tea

Relishing the silence
eating ice-cream
contemplating egg donation

I still luv her
with her big scary glowing eyes
unless you know them

Delighting in God
munching at the air
contemplating going blonde

On my way home
hoping for strippers and crack
just saw a grown man licking ice cream off a cone

Relishing relish
eating cheetos
trying to forget what I think I know about art

Heading downtown to run an errand
hoping for druid love
just noticed I have surprisingly hairy arms
